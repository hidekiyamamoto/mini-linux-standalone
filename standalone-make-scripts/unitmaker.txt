# To make a unit for making standalone.io distros by yourself:
#1 - Fresh install Lubuntu (I tested with 14,15,16 x86 and AMD64)
#2 - apt-get install -y customizer
#3 - you are ready - to launch customizer, insted of using the menu entry i suggest you use terminal and digit "sudo customizer-gui", it's much more informative this way.
